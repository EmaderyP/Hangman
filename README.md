# Hangman
HangMan game writen with Python
Hangman game is word guessing game, I depened on file full of words and import it to the main file. 
using random library to choose a word.
using the user input and comparing it with the character where pointer is. if true go to next character, if false the user lose a life. 
the game keeps going until the user wins or loses all chances.

The next level that I am aiming for to create an Interface Compatible for this game...
